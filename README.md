ShutPub is a publisher-side middleware that moves content-based filtering functionality from the broker to the publisher so that only messages that have a recipient are transmitted.

## Broker
Using ActiveMQ to be the prototype broker.

The connection manager gets connection information, and subscription(filters) will be used by the inference engine to generate thresholds on meta topics.

Run [BrokerPSF](./src/main/java/org/example/broker/BrokerPSF.java) to start the broker,

You can apply your broker configuration by changing content in [Configuration](./src/main/java/org/example/cong/Configuration.java).

It is also possible to configure broker using a XML file, here is a [sample](./src/main/java/org/example/broker/activemq.xml), and the broker initialization code is provided in the comment.

## Subscriber
The Subscriber sends subscriptions that contain filters to the Broker.
Run [SimpleSubscriber](./src/main/java/org/example/subscriber/SimpleSubscriber.java) to start the subscriber.

## Publisher
A publisher middleware will initialize automatically with the publisher initialization.

The middleware will subscribe to the corresponding meta-topic, 
and when there is a filter value, the publisher will only send the filter-matching messages to the Broker.

Run ['SimplePSFPublisher'](./src/main/java/org/example/publisher/PublisherWithPSF.java) to start the publisher.
